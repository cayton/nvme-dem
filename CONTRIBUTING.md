## How to contribute to the Distributed Endpoint Management Project ##

Here you will find instructions on how to contribute to the NVM-Express
Distributed Endpoint Management project.

Contributions and new ideas are most welcome!

**NOTE: If you do decide to implement code changes and contribute them,
please make sure you agree your contribution can be made available under
the [Dual GPLv2 / BSD style Licenses used for the NVMe
DEM](https://github.com/linux-nvme/nvme-dem/blob/master/COPYING).**

**If you found a bug:**

-   **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub
    under [Issues](https://github.com/linux-nvme/nvme-dem/issues).

-   If you\'re unable to find an open issue addressing the
    problem, [open a new
    one](https://github.com/linux-nvme/nvme-dem/issues/new). Be sure to
    include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant
    information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable
    test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not
    occurring.

**If you wrote a patch that fixes a bug:**

-   Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

-   Ensure the description clearly describes the problem and solution.
    Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

**If you want to add a new feature or change an existing one:**

-   Suggest your change by sending email to the maintainer and start
    writing code.

-   Do not open an issue on GitHub until you have collected positive
    feedback about the change. GitHub issues are primarily intended for
    bug reports and fixes.

-   Once your new feature / feature-change has been accepted **update
    the relevant documentation.**

**If you have questions about the source code or how to use this
project:**

-   Reference the project README file.

-   Ask any question about how to use Distributed Endpoint Management by
    contacting the maintainer.

**If you want to contribute to Distributed Endpoint Management
documentation:**

-   The Distributed Endpoint Management project has two sets of
    documentation:

    -   The guide, which help you learn about Distributed Endpoint
        Management (functionality, components, installation steps,
        usage),

    -   The API, which serves as a reference.

-   You can help improve the guide by making it more coherent,
    consistent, or readable, adding missing information, correcting
    factual errors, fixing typos, or bringing them up to date with the
    latest version of the project.

-   To do so, make changes to Guides source files. 
    Then open a pull request to apply your changes to master
    branch
